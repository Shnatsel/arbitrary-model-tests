# arbitrary-model-tests

This is an attempt at creating a convenient procedural macro to be used for testing stateful models (in particular, various kinds of data structures) against a trivial (but usually very inefficient) implementation that is semantically 100% equivalent to the target implementation but, in contrast, *obviously* correct. The purpose of the macro is to generate the boilerplate code for testing particular operations of the model so that the user-provided definition of the test for a given stateful structure becomes as succinct as possible.

This crate was inspired by the following work:

* [https://github.com/blt/bughunt-rust](bughunt-rust)
* [https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz](cargo-fuzz)
* [https://github.com/rust-fuzz/honggfuzz-rs](honggfuzz-rs)

## Example

See the [`HashMap` test](src/tests/hash_map.rs) for reference.

You can run it with `cargo hfuzz`. You'll first need to install `honggfuzz` along with its system dependencies. See [this section](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/honggfuzz-rs#dependencies) for more details. When you're done, this is all it takes to run the test:

```
cargo hfuzz run hash_map
```

## DSL

This is the initial take at a DSL that describes the stateful model to be tested (`std::collections::HashMap` in this case).

```rust
arbitrary_stateful_operations! {
    model = ModelHashMap<K, V>,
    tested = HashMap<K, V>,
    
    type_parameters = <
        K: Clone + Debug + Eq + Hash + Ord,
        V: Clone + Debug + Eq + Ord
    >,

    methods {
        equal {
            fn clear(&mut self);
            fn contains_key(&self, k: &K) -> bool;
            fn get(&self, k: &K) -> Option<&V>;
            fn get_key_value(&self, k: &K) -> Option<(&K, &V)>;
            fn get_mut(&mut self, k: &K) -> Option<&mut V>;
            fn insert(&mut self, k: K, v: V) -> Option<V>;
            fn is_empty(&self) -> bool;
            fn len(&self) -> usize;
            fn remove(&mut self, k: &K) -> Option<V>;
        }

        equal_with(sort_iterator) {
            fn drain(&mut self) -> impl Iterator<Item = (K, V)>;
            fn iter(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = (&K, &V)>;
            fn iter_mut(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = (&K, &mut V)>;
            fn keys(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &K>;
            fn values(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &V>;
            fn values_mut(&mut self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &mut V>;
        }
    }
}
```
